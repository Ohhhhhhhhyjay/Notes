## About Stellar Stream

[VIA MACHINAE: Searching for stellar streams using unsupervised machine learning](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2022MNRAS.509.5992S/ARTICLE)

A stellar stream is an association of stars orbiting a galaxy that was once a globular cluster or dwarf galaxy that has now been torn apart and stretched out along its orbit by tidal forces.
- They have approximately linear structures over small angles on the sky.
- Cold streams are expected to be fully localized in both proper motions
- On large scales on the sky, most streams form arcs in $(\alpha, \delta)$ rather than lines. However, the deviation from a line for the stars in the stream is small across a 10° radius circle in the sky.

## Metallicity
For other stars, the metallicity is often expressed as "$\text{[Fe/H]}$", which represents the logarithm of the ratio of a star's iron abundance compared to that of the Sun.
