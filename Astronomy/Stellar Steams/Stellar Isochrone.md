# Stellar Isochrone
In stellar evolution, an isochrone is a curve on the H-R diagram, representing a population of stars of the same age but with different mass. 

>Given the abundances, we can locate the initial positions of stellar population on the zero-age main-sequence band. The next step involves numerically evolving the stellar population forward in time by the solving the stellar structure evolution as accurately as possible. We can thus calculate the luminosities and colours for all the stars in the population at any given later time; that is, we know the location of any given star in the CM diagram at any future time. Finally, we draw a line connecting all the stars in the CM diagram at any given time. Such a line, called an **isochrone**, provides a theoretical image of the steller population when the cluster has a specified age. It is possible to draw isochrones corresponding to different ages as well as those for the same age but for different input parameters and stellar-evolution models. A comparison of these isochrones with the observed sequence of stars in the globular clusters (by a statistical analysis for the best fit) should provide us not only the age of the globular cluster but also information on input parameters and assumptions regarding stellar evolution.
