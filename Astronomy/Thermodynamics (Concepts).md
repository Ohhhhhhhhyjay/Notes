## Thermodynamic System
与外界没有任何相互作用的系统称为孤立系统(isolated system)；与外界有能量交换但没有物质交换的系统称为封闭系统，简称闭系(closed system)；与外界既有能量交换又有物质交换的系统称为开放系统，简称开系(open system)。

| System | Energy exchange | Matter exchange |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
|Isolated|       no        |       no        |
| Closed |       yes       |       no        |
| Open   |       yes       |       yes       |


## Isothermal & Adiabatic
Isothermal (等温): constant temperature
An isothermal process is a process that happens when there are no variations in the temperature of the system, but other parameters (volume, pressure) regarding the system can be changed accordingly.

Adiabatic (绝热): isolated from surrondings
Adiabatic process describes a process that remains aloof from its surroundings. It is a process in which no heat transfer occurs between a system and its surroundings. Here, the temperature of the system can vary in order to avoid any heat transfer.
