In the case of a stationary gas, the Jeans stability criterion can be sued to compare the strength of gravity with that of thermal pressure. In the case of a differentially rotating disk, the shear force can provide and additional stabilizing force.

The Toomre criterion for a disk to be stable can be expressed as
$$
\frac{c_s \kappa}{\pi G\Sigma} > 1
$$
Where $c_s$ is the speed of sound (and measure of the thermal pressure), $\kappa$ is the epicyclic frequency, $G$ is Newton's gravitational constant, and $\Sigma$ is the surface density of the disk.


The _Toomre analysis_, first studied by [Viktor Safronov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Safronov "Viktor Safronov") in the 1960s, considers not only gravity and pressure, but also shear forces from differential rotation. **Conceptually, if a fluid is differentially rotating (such as in the keplerian motion) of an astrophysical disk), gravity not only has to overcome the internal pressure of the gas, but also needs to halt the relative motion between two parcels of fluid, allowing them to collapse together.**

The analysis was expanded upon by [Alar Toomre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alar_Toomre "Alar Toomre") in 1964, and presented in a more general and comprehensive framework.
