While a lot of cosmology quantities are dependent (not physically, could be just $H_0$ is used in the deduction) on hubble parameter, the precise value of Hubble constant are not decided yet. Therefore 2 common approach is, one, taking a fiducial value ($h=0.7$ for example), or, embedding dimensionless parameter $h$ into the unit.

$h$ is defined as
$$
h = H_0/(100\mathrm{\,km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}})
$$
