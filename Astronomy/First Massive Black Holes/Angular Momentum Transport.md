A dimensionless spin parameter
$$
\lambda = \frac{J}{\sqrt 2 Mv_cR}
$$
where $v_c=\sqrt{GM/R}$ is the Keplerian circular velocity.

## Angular Momentum Transport in Galaxy Formation
1. On the largest scales, both the gas and the collisionless components (DM and any pre-existing stars) develop non-axisymmetric morphologies.
2. Once the gas has cooled and contracted, it eventually becomes self-gravitating, and can develop its own non-axisymmetric bar-like structures, allowing continued gas inflow.
3.
