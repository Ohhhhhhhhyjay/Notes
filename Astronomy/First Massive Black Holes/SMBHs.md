Early SMBHs
- masses greater than $\sim 10^9 M_\odot$
- very rare, number density of $\sim 1\, Gpc^{-3}$ 
- $z > 6$
- currently discovered over 100
- Most massive: SDSS J010013.02+280225.8 $1.2\times10^{10} M_\odot$ at $z=6.3$
- Most distant: ULAS J1342+0928 $7.8\times10^{8} M_\odot$ at $z=7.54$

## How did the first SMBHs grow so large so fast?
Explaining the existence of $M \sim 10^9 M_\odot$ at $z=6-7$.
- Eddington-limited accretion form first Pop III BH remnants is unlikely.
- Even in models with massive BH seeds, a high duty cycle is required if accretion is Eddington limited.
- Even for the most massive and highest-redshift SMBHs, the time-averaged accretion rate needs to be only modestly (∼ twice) above the Eddingtonlimited rate for most BH seeding models.
- Only a tiny minority of early BHs, born in highly biased regions of the universe, grow to $∼ 10^9M_\odot$ by $z \gtrsim 6$. The vast majority of massive BHs, born in more typical regions, will remain far below this mass by this redshift.

Pathways to accelerate the assembly of massive BHs in high-z galaxies
- Lucky Pop III seeds managed $f_\text{duty} \sim 1$ + Compact objects mergers (but gravitational waves drives away resevoirs of dense gas)
