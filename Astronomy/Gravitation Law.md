## Newton's Law of Gravitation
$$
F = -G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}
$$
Vector form
$$
\vec F_{12} = -G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^3}\vec r_{12}
$$
Where the index $_{12}$ denotes the direction of the vector is from mass point 1 to mass point 2
## Gravitational Potential Energy
Gravitational potential is define as the work produced by gravitation to move the mass points away from each other to infinitely far away, where the zero point is set, i.e. $U(r=\infty) = 0$. 
$$
U = \int_r^\infty -G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}dr = -G\frac{m_1m_2}{r}.
$$
## Self Graviational Potential Energy
For a sphere of radius $R$ and total mass $M$ with constant density, the self gravitational potential energy is
$$
U = -\frac{3}{5}G\frac{M^2}{R}.
$$
Proof
$$
\begin{align}
U &= \int_0^{M}-G\frac{M(r)}{r}dm\\
&= \int_0^R-G\frac{Mr^3/R^3}{r}\rho4\pi r^2dr,\quad \rho=\frac{M}{4/3\pi R^3}\\
&= -G\frac{3M^2}{R^6}\int_0^Rr^4dr\\
&= -\frac{3}{5}G\frac{M^2}{R}.
\end{align}
$$
